Money Manager with useState, useEffect, react-circular-progressbar, react-swipeable-list and localStorage

This project is inspired by an application to keep track of the expenses that you are doing in the month, where I learned much more about how to handle the states in React and also the useEffect, the user can refresh the page and will not be deleted their expenses recorded with the use of LocalStorage.
I learned a lot more about React and there are still more things to come :)
